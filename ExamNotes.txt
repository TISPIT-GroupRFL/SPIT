1. Contents of a good specification

- Check that all parts match and everything is included
- Validate that stakeholders are happy (customer, user, developer)
- Where are the major risks?
- Quality product = meeting the spec?

- Write down business goals!

	- Word != meaning
	- Meaning != consequences for business
	- Show similar system/ pilot test.

- Unambiguous: Misunderstood
- Complete: Get all Non-trivial requirements written (Also get GUI in Task and Support)
- Consistent: No conflicts
- Verifiable: A "nice" user interface, isn't measurable.
- Modifiable: Categorize, prioritize and static labels in SRS
- Traceable: Forward and backward

- Describe data (Do CRUDO check on tasks vs. )
- Quality (performance, security, reliability, availability, interoperability, usability)
- ID on req.
- Risk assessment
- Tests
- Run through check list
