\section{Comparison of specification techniques}
%This part shall contain a comparison of pros and cons with different specification techniques and a reflection of your own experience in using different kinds of techniques (around 2 pages).


When writing specifications, different techniques can be used.
In the bachelor degree of this education the traditional standard of making use cases has been used and favored over all else.
It has worked nicely for multiple projects and each time has been a new challenge with new obtained knowledge of how to create a better specifications.

In TISPIT a new method was introduced to us which had a very different approach to dealing with a systems specification and design.
Group 6 was first introduced to this in an article in handin 2, \parencite[]{HI2}, when reading SÃ¸ren Lauesen's idea of Task-Description, \parencite[]{Task}.

The paper explained a second way of dealing with user's needs and why this approach would be easier to used, versus the old way of use cases.
The main argument of this article was, that using this method a lot of time was saved and according to another article, \parencite[]{Task2}, a quick survey showed that 45 \% of asked teams used this (or similar methods) in 2012 which only underlines, that this is a growing way of addressing customers needs today.

\textit{Why is Tasks better than the traditional approach?}
\\
Doing things faster is normally a good way to take, assuming the outcome is as good as the slower approach.
But it is not only a matter of speed -- it is a matter of understanding what is to be done in the specification.

In the traditional view use cases are created.
They state who interact with the system (hardware and software), what will happen step by step, what is needed for the software to run and what the outcome will be.
This is not a bad way of during it, but as a customer you be left behind thinking what all the fancy terms mean and only hoping that it will work.

In the Task-description approach the use cases are replaced by tasks the customer can understand from the customer's daily routines.
This could be \textit{check a hotel guest in to the system} and then describing what the customer already know, step by step, with small subtasks.
Now the customer can read and understand what is to become with the task, what he is paying for and the job will be done.
How it should be done is not specified yet.
With the same example it could be a guest coming to the counter asking an employee to check in the guest or it could a small screen with clear instructions the guest could check him self in with.
The outcome would be exactly the same -- only the execution would be different.
And this is where the time is saved making the specification.
If the contractor doesn't need to sit with a team of software engineers and almost design the system before it is approved, the contractor can just write what the customer wants, specify step by step of each task, let the customer approve it and then sit down with the engineers to design the system.
Imagine the engineers thought A let to B let to C, creates a use case from their understanding of the system based on how they what to implement it and the customer say A only leads to C and B is another part of the wanted solution -- now the use case, and properly others, has to be rewritten.
And this is only if the customer catches the error in time. 
If the implementation is halfway through and the customer finally understand, that this is an error, it could take months or years to redesign and reimplement, maybe with a lawsuit of delayed delivery too.
\\
\\
\textit{So it is faster and more reliable -- How about giving use cases subtask?}
\\
This would not work.
The main reason is, a use case is the system (software and hardware) performing something for the user(s)/actor(s).
Making a subtask for a use case is only letting a the software make a decision and not the user.

A task, on the other hand, will specify what the user \textit{and} the system should do together.
