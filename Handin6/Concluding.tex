\section{Concluding Remarks}
%This part shall contain your own reflections about the main challenges envisaged for precise and accurate specifications of IT systems and ways you see to mitigate such challenges from both a customer and a supplier perspective and set it in perspective to the articles presented in the course (around 1 page).

Engineers have always spoken in wierd terms and phrases -- always to each other any rarely with others.
The art of getting others to pay the engineers for a piece of software is therefor a difficult task, since the software language contains a lot of these wierd terms and phrases.
By making figures, tables and waving their arms engineers some times manage to convince a potential customer of a piece of software he can create.
Unless the customer knows a good portion about software making this has been a risky step to make, because the engineer charges a lot of money for this, and the customer only has a stack of papers with weird diagrams and word of which he hopes express what he actually wants and needs.
Should it fail it will result in loss of money, loss of valuable time and possible give a bad reputation for wasting money.

Even though a customer can bind the engineers to the contract and sue him for not following it, it has always been in both the contractor and the customer's best interest to complete the contract.
There are different ways for doing this but making a SRS is the norm.
