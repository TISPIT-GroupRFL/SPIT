\chapter{Data to record}
The system must record the data described in this chapter. The user can create, view, and change the data through the tasks described in Chapter \ref{cha:C}. 
In many cases data has to be exchanged with external systems as specified in Chapter \ref{cha:F}.

Figure \ref{fig:Datamodel} is a data model that gives an overview of the data. 
Each box is a class of data. 
Imagine a pile of file cards behind the box. 
The box symbolizes one of the cards. 

There are relationships between the boxes, shown as crow's feet. 
A crow's foot shows that a card relates to one or many cards in another pile. 
As an example, a group can contain many students, but a student can one relate to only one group. 
Data need not be structured this way in the system, but it must be handled in some way. 

The dotted boxes show data that are (partly) shared with external systems.
