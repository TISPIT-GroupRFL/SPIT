\section{Login and access right for users}\label{sec:login}
Login is not a separate user task, but subtasks that occur in many tasks. The system must support the following subtasks relating to the user's access rights. 

\begin{TaskTable}
\Record{Identify the user with the existing user identification, login method, and time-out method, which is the school's existing single-signon LDAP system. This system is described in section \ref{sec:LDAP}.}{}{}

\Record{Check that only authorized users get access to systems and data.}{The database system checks the rights.}{}
\end{TaskTable}
