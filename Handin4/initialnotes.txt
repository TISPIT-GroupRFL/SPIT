Lecturer tasks:
 - Manage students
   - add students - possible solution: import from CN group + manually
   - remove students

 - Add excersize
   - add excercise + description, deadline, deadline for resubmission, max number of group members, number of reviewers
     
 - Update excercise (preconditions? what if there are submissions already?)
   - change parameters given when excercise was added.
   - send notification to students
   
 - Assess submission + review status
   - provide overview - suggestion for solution: filter on status
     - current problem: students send reviews as email to lecturer - time consuming to keep track of.
   - read reviews and submissions (both original and resubmissions)
  
Student tasks:
 - Submit handin
   - submit handin
    
   - variants: update submission, resubmission, past deadline
 
 - Submit review
   - submit commented version of handin, comments, okay/not okay
   - send review to reviewee
   - add review to lecturer's overview
   - variants: past deadline
   
Events:
 - deadline for submission
   - Assign reviewers (minimal repetition, reviewers cannot be in your group, reviewers should not be assigned to multiple members of the same group)
     - Current problem: doing this by hand is cumbersome 
   - distribute handin to reviewers
   
Questions for Joey: 
 - Should groups be formed in advance of handing in? - when should reviewers be assigned? groups??
 - What does "Ensuring that repetition of assignments of a given student to a (set of) peer(s) is minimised" mean?
 - special cases for bending deadlines?
 - what should happen when submitting past deadlines? 
 - Update excercise (preconditions? what if there are submissions already?)
