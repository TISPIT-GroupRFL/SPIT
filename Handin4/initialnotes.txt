Lecturer tasks:
 - Manage students
   - add students - possible solution: import from CN group + manually (stads) 
   - remove students
   
 - manage groups
   - pull students out of group
   - add student to group
   - create group
   - delete group   
   - exclude student from review list
   


 - Add excersize
   - add excercise + description, deadline, deadline for resubmission, max number of group members, number of reviewers
   - variant: no review
   
   deadlines:
   initial submission
   review 
   resubmission
     
 - Update excercise (preconditions? what if there are submissions already?)
   - change parameters given when excercise was added.
   - send notification to students
   
   - nice to have: versioning
   
 - Assess submission + review status

   - provide overview - suggestion for solution: filter on status
     - current problem: students send reviews as email to lecturer - time consuming to keep track of.
   - read reviews and submissions (both original and resubmissions)
   - see track record for group / student
   - manually override submission status for groups:   
   - also as student: here are those you need to review, released on deadline
   - freeze reviews / submission
	
   
   review assignments on deadline. 
   
   
 
  
Student tasks:
 - Submit handin
   - submit handin    
   - variants: update submission, resubmission, past deadline, not final submission
 
 - Submit review
   - submit commented version of handin, comments, okay/not okay
   - send review to reviewee (reviewee's option)
   - add review to lecturer's overview
   - variants: past deadline, update review (reupload).
   
 - Create group
  - add peers
  - require peers accept
   
   
   
Events:
 - deadline for submission
   - Assign reviewers (individual students) (minimal repetition, reviewers should not be in your group, reviewers should not be assigned to multiple members of the same group)
     - Current problem: doing this by hand is cumbersome 
   - distribute handin to reviewers

 - deadline for reviews
  - distribute feedback to reviewees
   
Questions for Joey: 
 - Should groups be formed in advance of handing in? - when should reviewers be assigned? groups??
  - groups are mostly fixed, but live, groups -> review assignments
 
 - special cases for bending deadlines? timestamp + flag
 - what should happen when submitting past deadlines? timestamp + flag 
 - Update excercise (preconditions? what if there are submissions already?) timestamp + notice
 
 - deadlines: 
   - possible to upload past deadline, just flag as late
   
 - dealing with duplication of review assignments should be possible
