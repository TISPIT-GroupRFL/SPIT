\section{Supplier guide}

This chapter explains the requirements format and how the supplier describes his solution.
\\
All requirements are written in tables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Column 1 is the requirement (the customer's demand - what he wants the system to support). 

\item Column 2 may be the customer's solution example or the supplier's proposed solution.

\item Column 3 may be the customer's rating of the proposed solution, a reference to a sub-delivery, or something else.

\end{itemize}

The requirements are organized in chapters according to their kind, e.g. Chapter \ref{cha:C} about user tasks to be supported, Chapter \ref{cha:H} about security. 
Within each chapter, the requirements are written in tables, e.g. a table with requirements relating to a specific task.
