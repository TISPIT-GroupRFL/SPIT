\chapter{Integration with external systems}\label{cha:F}

The system must integrate more or less closely with the external systems shown in Figure 8 (context diagram). The integration comprises data sharing or replication, and the ability for the user to activate functionality in the external systems. 
\\
In this Chapter, "customer" means the customer's own IT staff or a third party authorized by him.
\\
\\
\textbf{System data (S-data)} are the integrated data stored locally in the system, S.\\
\textbf{External data (E-data)} are the integrated data stored in the external system, E.

Here is a short explanation of the external systems:

\begin{enumerate}
\item STADS the \textbf{St}udy \textbf{Ad}ministrative \textbf{S}ystems (danish: studieadministrative systemer). This system is employed by Aarhus University(AU) to handle course enrolling and related tasks.
\item The single sign-on system employed by AU  implements LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
\end{enumerate}
