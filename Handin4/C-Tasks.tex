\chapter{C-Tasks/Tasks to support}\label{cha:C}
The system must support all user tasks in this chapter, including all subtasks and variants, and mitigate the problems. The subtasks are numbered for reference purposes. They don't have to be carried out in this sequence, and many of them are optional. The user decides what to do and in which sequence. A subtask may also be repeated during the same task.

\section{Work area: Student management}
This work area comprises adding and removing students from the system.
