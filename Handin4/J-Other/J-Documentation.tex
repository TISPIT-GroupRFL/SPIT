\section{Documentation}
The customer expects that only super users, IT support staff, and systems developers will read the documentation. 
Thus there is no need for beginner's documentation, except for course material.


\begin{DocTable}
\Doc
{Before system delivery, course material must be available for super users to use when teaching other users.}
{}
{}

\Doc
{A month after system delivery, user-oriented documentation of all system functions must be available. 
The documentation must be suited for super users.}
{}
{}

\Doc
{Before system delivery, sufficient documentation must be available for the customer to handle his part of IT operation and support. }
{}
{}

\Doc
{For specially developed software and technical interfaces for third-party development, sufficient documentation for further development must be available two months after system delivery. }
{}
{}

\Doc
{All documentation must be delivered in electronic form. 
The customer may freely modify it and copy it for his own use. }
