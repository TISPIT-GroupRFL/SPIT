\section{Business goals}
The customer's reason to acquire the system is to reach some business goals. 
The customer expects that the system contributes to the goals as stated below. 
The supplier can rarely reach the goals alone. Customer contribution is needed too. 
This means that the goals are not requirements to the supplier. 
They are shown in a table only to provide overview. 
\\
\\
All goals are important and the sooner they can be met, the better. 
Some goals are crucial to meet at a specific date, for instance for business or legal reasons. 
Such deadlines are shown in the table.
