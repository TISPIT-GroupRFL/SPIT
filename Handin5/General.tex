\section{General}
In general the System Requirement Specification, SRS, seems unfinished.
Lots of chapters are listed but not filled with any content which only worsen the impression of the document.

When reading a SRS it is always a good idea to have an overview of what the system will do.
This has for some reason been moved to the front page on 3 lines which should have been listed under section 1.6.
\\
Another critical key missing, is the customer's business goals.
It would appear these are about IBM having easy access to the joiners of the course through a PDF file, but it is not listed.
\\
\\
Each requirement has been assigned an ID, which is nice, but it does not appear to be in any system.
This only causes confusion for the reader of the document.

Most of the requirements are well written from the transcript attached -- however the transcript seems misplaced for an SRS document.

Under section 2.1, in the figure without a title or number, it is listed the web browser access a VPN, but it not mentioned anywhere else and ti does not seems like a requirement for the system.
Also the web service has been defined as HTTP and XML -- very specific, considering the developers may want to use JSON instead of XML.
Again, XML was not a requirement.
