\section{Checklist}

This section provides a checklist approach to inspect an SRS. The questions used in this section are relevant questions from the requirements verification checklist used by \textit{System Development Life Cycle process (SDLC)}.

\subsection{Correct}
A Requirements Specification is correct if, and only if, every requirement stated therein is one that the system/software shall meet.

\begin{longtable}{p{8cm} | p{7.3cm}}
\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Yes / No / NA} \\ \hline

Is the expected response time, from the userâ€™s point of view, specified for all necessary operations? & No. Only specified for one operation (Req ID 20140228-212400) \\ \hline

Are other timing considerations specified, such as processing time, data transfer, and throughput? & No. \\ \hline

Are all the tasks to be performed by the system/software specified? & No. Handling new joiners on the day is not clearly specified. \\ \hline

Does each task specify the data/information content used in the task and the data/information content resulting from the task? & No. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Req ID 20140301-103401 - List printing - Does not specify what data to be printed for each person.
\item Req ID 20140301-103403 - Adding employee in PIS - Relevant data for an employee not specified.
\end{itemize} \\ \hline

Are the physical security requirements specified? & N/A \\ \hline
Are the operational security requirements specified? & Yes \\ \hline

Is the reliability of the system/software specified, including the consequences of failure, vital information protected from failure, error detection, and recovery? & Yes. \\ \hline

Are acceptable trade-offs between competing attributes specified, for example, between robustness and correctness? & No. \\ \hline

Are internal interfaces, such as software and hardware, defined? & N/A. \\ \hline

Are external interfaces, such as users (e.g., people), software, and hardware defined? & Partially. \begin{itemize}
\item TIS/PIS interface does not specify data/format.
\item Food/drinks ordering and room reservation were mentioned in section 2.1 "Product perspective" but not specified.
\end{itemize} \\ \hline

Is the definition of success included? Of failure? & Yes. Availability required is specified in Req ID 20140228-213700. \\ \hline

Is each requirement relevant to the problem and its solution? & Yes. However, Food/drinks ordering and room reservation were mentioned in section 2.1 "Product perspective" but have not been requested by the customer. \\ \hline

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Unambiguous}
A Requirements Specification is unambiguous if, and only if, every requirement stated therein has only one interpretation.

\begin{longtable}{p{8cm} | p{7.3cm}}
\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Yes / No / NA} \\ \hline
