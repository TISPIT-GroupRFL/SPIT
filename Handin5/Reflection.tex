\chapter{Reflection}

The review from Group 5 is useful in many ways:

\begin{itemize}

\item A document ID has been added to all pages, so new versions can't be mixed with old versions.

\item A requirement ID has been added to all sections in the document.

\item A list of abbreviation is added.

\item Corrected text regarding maintaining

\item Bad reference updated 

\end{itemize}
This is some of the feedback that are actually useful for the SRS.

Listed was also that the 4+1-model should be used (which it should not, since this belongs in the Design document for the system), and the requirement's IDs should be "grep-friendly", here meaning it should be possible to search for them.

Comparing Task-Description vs. the traditional way of writing the customer's requirement, Task-Description seems easier to both write and understand.

The reviewer was not in doubt of what should happen, or what the outcome would be of this given operation.
